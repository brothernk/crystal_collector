# Crystal Collector

This game was created in week four of the University of MN Coding Bootcamp. Every time the page is loaded a new target number appears. Each of the crystal images is assigned a random number. The goal of the game is to click the images until the target number is reached. If the user goes over the target number they lose and a new target number is generated. If they win they get a point before the new number generates.
